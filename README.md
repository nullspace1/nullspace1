### Hi there!

Welcome to my profile.

I'm an engineering student at Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Argentina. This account is used both for university and personal projects.

Currently learning Python :snake: - focusing on trying to improve my ability to read code/pseudocode and implement on my own.

I'm planning on doing a lot of C / C++ over the summer as well, in preparation for some courses I plan on taking.

As you can probably tell, this is a work in progress kind of thing. As I continue learning, I'll be adding more and more things here.
